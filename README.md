#### Data exploration 
In this jupyter notebook, we explore the data, checking for missing value and having a first glance at the text we can find in the review. We also do a very quick check of the number reviews for each two label.
All that is done to have a vague idea of the data we are working with.  

#### Model 
We start by preprocessing the data (which is text).  
Then we make a baseline model using *LogisticRegression* from *sklearn*.  
From those two step before, we build a pipeline that extracture feature from a given data and fit a model, then we will be able to predict.
